          <p>A BMI calculation in the healthy weight range is between 18.5 to 24.9.

            For Black, Asian and some other minority ethnic groups, the healthy weight range is 18.5 to 23.
            
            For people of White heritage, a BMI:
            
            below 18.5 is underweight
            between 18.5 and 24.9 is healthy
            between 25 and 29.9 is overweight
            of 30 or over is obese</p>

            <button class="accordion">How the BMI is calculated</button>
         <div class="panel">
            <p> The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms (kg) by their height in metres (m) squared.

            For example, if you weigh 70kg (around 11 stone) and are 1.73m (around 5 feet 8 inches) tall, you work out your BMI by:
            
            squaring your height: 1.73x1.73 = 2.99
            dividing 70 by 2.99 = 23.41 </p>
